## About the landing page project

This project has 4 sections and you can add more, if you want.
If you added a new section in the `index.html` file. the navigation will add one item automatically to the menu link. 
and if you added another section. the navigation will back again to add a new item to the menu link, above. and so on. 
This project has a lot of experience which I learned when I was thinking about typing and running the code.
